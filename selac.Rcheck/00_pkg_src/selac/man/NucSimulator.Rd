\title{Simulate DNA under General-Time Reversible model}
\usage{
NucSimulator(phy, pars, nsites, nuc.model, base.freqs, ncats)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{The phylogenetic tree with branch lengths.}

\item{pars}{A vector of parameters used for the simulation. They are ordered as follows: gamma shape and the rates for the nucleotide model.}

\item{nsites}{The number of sites to simulate.}

\item{nuc.model}{Indicates what type nucleotide model to use. There are three options: "JC", "GTR", or "UNREST".}

\item{base.freqs}{The base frequencies for A C G T (in that order).}

\item{ncats}{The number of discrete gamma categories.}
}
\description{
Simulates nucleotide data based on parameters under the GTR+G model
}
\details{
Simulates a nucleotide matrix using parameters under the GTR+G model. Note that the output can be written to a fasta file using the write.dna() function in the \code{ape} package.
